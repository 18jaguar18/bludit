## Installation on GNU/Linux
If you have a local webserver with GNU/Linux or you have a Hosting with SSH enabled, you can install with this simples commands.

```
$ wget http://www.bludit.com/bludit_latest.zip
$ unzip bludit_latest.zip
$ mv bludit /WEBSERVER_DIRECTORY/
```

If you don’t have the command wget, you can try with the command curl.
```
$ curl --remote-name http://www.bludit.com/bludit_latest.zip
```

I recommend you check which user are running your webserver, because you need to set read/write permissions to the directory `content`. For example if you are running Apache you can do this:
```
$ sudo ps axo user | egrep '(apache|httpd)' | uniq
```

Now you can set the username to the directory `content`. And fix some permissions to the files and directories.
```
$ cd /WEBSERVER_DIRECTORY/bludit
$ sudo chown -R USERNAME:USERNAME content
$ sudo find . -type f | xargs chmod 664
$ sudo find . -type d | xargs chmod 775
```

Other way, but I don’t recommend it, is setting the permissions for all read/write/execute (777).
```
$ cd /WEBSERVER_DIRECTORY/bludit
$ sudo find content -type d | xargs chmod 777
```
